            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER SENT FROM THE EARLE OF STRAFFORD TO HIS LADY into IRELAND a little before his death, <hi>May the</hi> 11. 1641.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou ſhall receive my dear wife, my laſt words, in theſe my laſt times; my love I ſend that you may keepe it when I am dead, and my counſell that you may remember it when I am no more: I would not with my will preſent you ſorrowes (dear wife) let them go to the grave with me and be buried in the duſt, and ſeeing it is not the will of God, that I ſhall ſee you any more, beare my diſtraction patiently, and with an heart like your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſend you all the thankes which my heart can conceive or my words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, for your many travells and cares
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101720:4"/> for me, which though they have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken effect as you wiſhed, yet my debt to you is no leſſe; but pay it I never ſhall in this world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I beſeech you for the love you bare me living, that you do not hide your ſelf many daies, but by your travell ſeek to helpe the miſerable fortune and the right of your poore children, your mourning cannot availe any thing that am but duſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you ſhall underſtand that my lands were conveied <hi>(bona fide)</hi> unto my ſonne, the writings were drawne at Midſummer was twelve month, as divers can witneſſe: to what friend to direct you I know not, for all mine have left me in the true time of triall; moſt ſorry am I that being thus ſurpriſed by death I can leave you no better eſtate; God hath prevented all my determinations, that great God that worketh all in all; &amp; if you can live free from want, care forno more, for the reſt is but vanity. Love God and begin betimes in him, ſo ſhall you find true everlaſting comfort, when you have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101720:4"/> travelled and wearied your ſelfe with all ſorts of worldly cogitations, you ſhall ſit down with ſorrow in the end: Teach your ſonne alſo to feare and ſerve God whilſt he is yong, that the feare of God may grow upon him; then will God be an husband to you, and a father to him, and a husband and a father that never can be taken away from you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balo</hi> oweth me 10000 pound, and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 100. pound, in Iernſey I have alſo much owing me.</p>
            <p>Deare wife, I beſeech you for my ſoules ſake, pay all poore men when I am dead: no doubt you ſhall be much ſought unto, for the world thinkes I was very rich. Have a care to faire pretence of men, for no greater miſery can befall you in this life, then to be a prey unto the world, and after to be deſpiſed. I ſpeake, God knowes, not to diſſwade you from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying againe, for that will be the beſt for you, both in reſpect of God, and of the world. As for me, I am no more yours, nor you mine; death hath cut us aſunder,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101720:4"/> and God hath divided me from the world and you from me. Remember my childe for his fathers ſake, who loved you in his happieſt eſtate. I ſued for my life, but God knowes it was for you and yours that I deſired it, for know it, my deare wife, your child is the ſon of a true man, who in his owne reſpect deſpiſeth death.</p>
            <p>I cannot write much, God knowes how hardly I ſteale time, when all are aſleepe: And it is alſo time to ſeparate my thoughts from the world. Beg my dead body, which living, was denied; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay it in Aleaune or Antley by my Father and mother. I can ſay no more, time and death calls me away. The ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God powerfull, infinite, inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, God almighty, who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, the true light and life, keepe you and yours, and have mercy upon me.</p>
